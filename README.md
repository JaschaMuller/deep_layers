### Basic structure of data management plugin

## S-2 download not working yet - needs some decision making since cogs are freely available

To install the plugin, just copy or pull/clone this repo in your plugin directory
e.g. /c/users/user/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/deep_layers

Decisions:
 - Should download still happen on S-2 grid tile?
 - Should dowload happen on user defined AOI?
 - Is eo-patches the right way to go for optimising data organization?
